# üöÄ Basecamp Booster+
Loving boost in Basecamp, but hate having only 16 characters to do it with? Then **Booster+** is for you.
With this simple tool, you can change the boost character limit and boooost like never before.

## Installation
Download the extension from the [Add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/basecamp-booster/) or [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/basecamp-booster+/idbbpaggdcdhnkebeankodicmecjfkld).

## Install from GitHub
To install the extension from GitHub directly (off-store), download the latest release as a zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/alefranzoni/basecamp-booster-plus/releases) page and add it to your browser.
- For **Firefox**, using the `Load Temporary Add-on` option in developer mode
- For **Chromium**, using the `Load unpacked extension` option in developer mode.

## Usage
Just install the extension and that's all! However, if you need to increase the character limit, which is 100 by default, just click on the extension icon and set the options as you wish.

In the settings floating menu you will see that there is a *Delay* option, this is the waiting time (in milliseconds) before searching for the component to be edited. Adjust this time **only if** the extension is not working properly.
